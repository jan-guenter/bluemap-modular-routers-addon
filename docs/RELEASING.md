# Release procedure

Releases are promoted only from an owner-accepted, independently audited
commit on `main`. The accepted candidate identity is recorded in
`provenance/release.json`.

## Clean gate

Use Java 21, a complete Gradle distribution, the exact sibling BlueMap
checkout, and the exact local Modular Routers and Glassential add-on artifacts:

```bash
gradle --no-daemon \
  -PmodularRoutersJar=/absolute/path/modular-routers-13.2.7+mc1.21.1.jar \
  -PglassentialAddonJar=/absolute/path/bluemap-glassential-addon-0.1.0-alpha.1.jar \
  -PreleaseTag=v0.1.0-alpha.1 \
  clean check build generatePomFileForAddonPublication \
  generateMetadataFileForAddonPublication verifyPublicationArtifacts \
  verifyReleaseCandidate
```

Inspect the production and sources JARs. Reject NeoForge metadata, nested
JARs, third-party classes/assets, gallery output, tests, research data, or
unexpanded metadata.

## Runtime and publication

Run the deterministic [gallery](../gallery/README.md) against that exact JAR,
open the intended BlueMap link for the required lightweight sanity check, and
obtain explicit owner acceptance. Do not substitute a functional rebuild
afterward; only the recorded final-version manifest transition is permitted.

Before tagging, merge the independently audited release pull request. Create
and push an annotated `v<addon_version>` tag at that reviewed `main` commit.
The release workflow reproduces every accepted byte, creates a draft
prerelease, uploads and attests the assets, publishes the Maven package,
verifies the draft assets, and only then makes the prerelease public.

Never reuse or move a release tag. A failed prepublication run may be resumed
with the workflow's exact immutable tag input while its GitHub release remains
a draft. Publication deploys nothing to the Minecraft server.
